/**
 * A query in the JCR query object model.
 *
 * The JCR query object model describes the queries that can be evaluated by a JCR
 * repository independent of any particular query language, such as SQL.
 *
 * A query consists of:
 *
 * a source. When the query is evaluated, the source evaluates its selectors and
 * the joins between them to produce a (possibly empty) set of node-tuples. This
 * is a set of 1-tuples if the query has one selector (and therefore no joins), a
 * set of 2-tuples if the query has two selectors (and therefore one join), a set
 * of 3-tuples if the query has three selectors (two joins), and so forth.
 * an optional constraint. When the query is evaluated, the constraint filters the
 * set of node-tuples.
 * a list of zero or more orderings. The orderings specify the order in which the
 * node-tuples appear in the query results. The relative order of two node-tuples
 * is determined by evaluating the specified orderings, in list order, until
 * encountering an ordering for which one node-tuple precedes the other. If no
 * orderings are specified, or if for none of the specified orderings does one
 * node-tuple precede the other, then the relative order of the node-tuples is
 * implementation determined (and may be arbitrary).
 * a list of zero or more columns to include in the tabular view of the query
 * results. If no columns are specified, the columns available in the tabular view
 * are implementation determined, but minimally include, for each selector, a column
 * for each single-valued non-residual property of the selector's node type.
 *
 * The query object model representation of a query is created by factory methods in the QueryObjectModelFactory.
