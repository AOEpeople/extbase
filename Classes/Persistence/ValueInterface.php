/**
 * A generic holder for the value of a property. A Value object can be used
 * without knowing the actual property type (STRING, DOUBLE, BINARY etc.).
 *
 * Any implementation of this interface must adhere to the following behavior:
 *
 * Two Value instances, v1 and v2, are considered equal if and only if:
 * * v1.getType() == v2.getType(), and,
 * * v1.getString().equals(v2.getString())
 *
 * Actually comparing two Value instances by converting them to string form may not
 * be practical in some cases (for example, if the values are very large binaries).
 * Consequently, the above is intended as a normative definition of Value equality
 * but not as a procedural test of equality. It is assumed that implementations
 * will have efficient means of determining equality that conform with the above
 * definition. An implementation is only required to support equality comparisons on
 * Value instances that were acquired from the same Session and whose contents have
 * not been read. The equality comparison must not change the state of the Value
 * instances even though the getString() method in the above definition implies a
 * state change.
 *
 * The deprecated getStream() method and it's related exceptions and rules have been
 * omitted in this PHP port of the API.
