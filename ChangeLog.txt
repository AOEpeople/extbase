ChangeLog for Fluid
===================

Changes for 1.3.0 Alpha 2
=========================
included in TYPO3 4.5.0 Alpha 2.

Since the last version, one (possible BREAKING) change happened:

 * Fixed Extbase Caching Bug.
   Non-cacheable actions were cached due to the fact that TYPO3s
   TypoScript condition "GP" does not merge GET & POST vars.
   Additionally "switchableControllerActions" that were overridden
   in the plugin flexform were not taken into account.

!!! This is a breaking change if you set up your TS configuration
    of the plugin manually.

[!!!][+BUGFIX] Extbase: Fix Extbase Caching Bug (thanks to Bastian Waidelich)

[-TASK] Extbase (MVC): removed fallback to current page in AbstractController::redirect() as that's already done within the UriBuilder if $targetPageUid is NULL


Changes for 1.3.0 Alpha 1
=========================
included in TYPO3 4.5.0 Alpha 1.

Since the last version, the following notable things happened:

* All methods trying to find an object by uid now ignore the storagePid. This changes the behavior of argument mapping and the way extbase fetches 1:1 relations. Resolves #5631. You should not experience any negative side-effects of this change, i.e. if your extension worked before, it will definitely after this change. However, it makes the record handling more robust.
* Performance improvements in TypoScript::convertTypoScriptArrayToPlainArray. Thanks to Timo Schmidt.
* Numerous other bugfixes, see below.
