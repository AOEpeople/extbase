ChangeLog for Extbase
=====================

Changes for 1.3.0 Alpha 2
=========================
included in TYPO3 4.5.0 Alpha 2.

Since the last version, one (possible BREAKING) change happened:

 * Fixed Extbase Caching Bug.
   Non-cacheable actions were cached due to the fact that TYPO3s
   TypoScript condition "GP" does not merge GET & POST vars.
   Additionally "switchableControllerActions" that were overridden
   in the plugin flexform were not taken into account.

!!! This is a breaking change if you set up your TS configuration
    of the plugin manually.

[!!!][+BUGFIX] Extbase: Fix Extbase Caching Bug (thanks to Bastian Waidelich)

[-TASK] Extbase (MVC): removed fallback to current page in AbstractController::redirect() as that's already done within the UriBuilder if $targetPageUid is NULL


Changes for 1.3.0 Alpha 1
=========================
included in TYPO3 4.5.0 Alpha 1.

Since the last version, the following notable things happened:

* All methods trying to find an object by uid now ignore the storagePid. This changes the behavior of argument mapping and the way extbase fetches 1:1 relations. Resolves #5631. You should not experience any negative side-effects of this change, i.e. if your extension worked before, it will definitely after this change. However, it makes the record handling more robust.
* Performance improvements in TypoScript::convertTypoScriptArrayToPlainArray. Thanks to Timo Schmidt.
* Numerous other bugfixes, see below.

RELEASE NOTES of Extbase v1.0.0
===============================

This package contains the Extbase Framework for Extensions. You may
also want to install the BlogExample (blog_example) to experiment
with. This little example extension demonstrates some of the main
features of Extbase. The documentation is bundled in a separate
extension called doc_extbase. Both, the blog_example and the
doc_extbase can downloaded via TER.

http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/blog_example/current/
http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/doc_extbase/current/

Currently Extbase is in ALPHA state. Do not expect everything in the
right place and shape. And keep in mind that the API may change
until TYPO3 v4.3beta1 is released.

If you have any feature requests or encountered issues regarding
this package please use the facilities on forge to report.

We are very open to answer your questions. Please use the newsgroup

typo3.projects.typo3v4mvc on lists.netfielders.de

so other developers can react to your comments and also
profit from the postet solutions. Do not contact a member of the
development team via private email (or skype, or visits, or ...)
until he accepted this channel. We all do coding for Extbase on
our sparetime and must handle our regular work load - and don't
forget about our families ;-).

We hope you have fun with this package!
