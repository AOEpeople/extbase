	• Dispatcher -> "action"-Argument needs to be namespaced. What happens if we have e.g. multiple blogs at one page? -> We need some unique ID
		• [DONE] Request -> should be prototype
		• [DONE] Instead of a type hint for "AbstractController", we should use "ControllerInterface" (Dispatcher.php line 97)
		• CSRF problems? Ideas?
			• "Transaction" with "Transaction ID"
			• Postpone this to 4.4
			• Idea: making checks in the Actions -> Certain actions should only accept POST (the "updateAction" would only do something if called with HTTP POST)
		• Extension Key
		• [->TYPO3 framework] AdditionalHeaderData -> we need to make sure that f.e. jQuery is only embedded once

	• Make MVC work with the new autoloader of 4.3
	• RealURL testing
	• [DONE] Directory "Classes/Web" -> should be "Classes/Controller/Web"?? -> JR: I dont't think so 
	• [DONE] Persistence_Session->clear() .... ->removeAll() should be replaced by "new SPLObjectStorage"
	• Documentation: Document the _stuff (CGL!!)
	• Naming (CGL!!)
	• [DONE] AbstractDomainObject -- "cleanProperties" should be renamed to "_cleanProperties"
	• AbstractDomainObject->uid should go to Entity
	• [DONE] Persistence_Repository -- remove $blacklistedFindByProperties
	• [DONE] Persistence_Repository - protected $persistence session -- rename to $persistence session
	• [DONE] Persistence_Repository -- strip out "enableFields" from "cObj"  to TSFE, and use TSFE instead of cObj
	• [DONE] Persistence_Repository->findOne() REMOVE
	• [-> 4.4] Query Object support? (Jan-Erik Revsbech)
	• [DONE] Persistence_Repository->findWhere() -- add enableFields by default (but make it possible to switch it of)
	• Persistence_Mapper_DataMap -- implement "aliasing" (Use case: Long name -> tx_twitter_something_twitter -> "twitterName", so you can say "findByTwitterName" )
	• Persistence_Mapper_DataMap -- tstamp is not needed, same for cruser_id
	• Persistence_Mapper_DataMap->setTypeOfValue  -- we need to explode stuff and not use strpos
	• Persistence_Mapper_DataMap -- check with IRRE (Olly)
	• [-> 4.4] throw away all comma separated lists, and replace them with MM tables
	• Is CreationDate and tstamp updated on updates?
	• ObjectRelationalMapper->fetch() -- instead of "$where", which is a string, pass on an array. A "printf" string, and all values which get quoted automatically (Andi Förthner)
	• ObjectRelationalMapper -- first delete relations, then relate the root
	• [DONE] ObjectRelationalMapper -- rename "$recursionMode" to "$recurseIntoRelations"
	• Put Configuration, Validation and Utility into t3lib
	• [DONE] method dispatch() too long
	• [DONE] ->buildRequest()
	• [DONE] ->getControllerSettings(xy)
	• Caching -> Talk with Stucki


* ValueObjects dürfen sich NIE MEHR verändern!!
* ValueObjects -> RefCount - TCEMAIN HOOK?
	* Alternative: Merge on insert??


KICKSTARTER -> GSoC


The SQL statements should be issued in the following order

    * all entity insertions, in the same order the corresponding objects were added using $repository->add($object)
    * all entity updates
    * all collection deletions
    * all collection element deletions, updates and insertions
    * all collection insertions
    * all entity deletions, in the same order the corresponding objects were removed using $repository->remove($object)

Featuers planned for 4.4
- Extendability of classes via mix-in (the function calls will be called magcally from the extended object; the mixed-in object should extend an AbstractDomainObjectExtender)
